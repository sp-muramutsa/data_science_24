## NETFLIX
It has been a considerable amount of time since I started learning Data Science. However, I have been very inconsistent and have not felt like I my progress is enough due to not having taken a "real world" project in my own hands. Well, not anymore! I stumbled on this gem, Python Data Science December decided to replicate the projects in the series. Today, we are analyzing my family's Netflix data. I requested my family's data from Netflix and in this project, I'm going to clean it and visualize it using Python Pandas and Matplotlib libraries.
